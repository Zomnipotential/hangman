# Hangman
This is my version of the game Hangman, which is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries(/y) to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.
